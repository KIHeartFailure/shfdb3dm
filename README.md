# R code for SwedeHFdatabase 3 (SHFDB3)

The aim of this R code is to be transparant and document the data management to
create SwedeHFdatabase 3 (SHFDB3).

## Language 

English. 

## Data

The data consists of Swedish individual patient data and is not public, 
and therefore no data is stored in this repository. 

## Instructions

The project uses the R package projectTemplate, http://projecttemplate.net/ and 
is structured (and run) accordingly. 
Renv, https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html, is used for 
management of package dependencies.

Since the data is not available the code can not be run as is.
